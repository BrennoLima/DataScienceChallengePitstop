DS - 1.   The following 2 data sets  data0 and data1 each contain   3 independent variables
   X and a dependent variable Y.   You can use the script provided:  mregress.py to 
   read the data and perform a regression analysis, but feel free to use any tool
   you want.
   
   For each data set:
   
   i)   assess the goodness of fit  of the regression model
   ii)  are all the variables necessary?  why or why not? if not how would you
        eliminate variables?
   iii) are the regressions statistically significant? explain what this means
  
  
  
DS2 - 2.  The CSV files;  alternator_actions.csv   and starter_actions.csv contain natural
   language descriptions written by mechanics when vehicles have had the
   'alternator' or the 'starter motor' replaced.  The first column is the description and
   the second column contains the string 'alternator' or 'starter'.
   
   In 2 pages or less develop a plan to classify the descriptions, and automatically
   determine which part has been replaced.  Be specific, and explain in terms which can
   be understood by someone who is not a specialist in natual language processing.
   Estimate the accuracy of your proposed model.
   
   State which libraries you might use and what might have to be written from scratch.
   Explain how you would validate the model on a larger data set.
